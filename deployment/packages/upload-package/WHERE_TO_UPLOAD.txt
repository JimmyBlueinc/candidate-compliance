# WHERE TO UPLOAD FILES - IMPORTANT!

## Understanding Shared Hosting Structure

When you log into your File Manager (cPanel, Plesk, etc.), you'll see something like:

```
/home/username/
├── public_html/          ← THIS IS WHERE YOUR WEBSITE FILES GO
│   └── (currently empty)
├── backend/              ← Backend goes here (create this folder)
└── other folders...
```

## Step-by-Step Upload Instructions

### STEP 1: Upload Frontend Files

**Location:** `public_html/` folder (this is your website root)

1. Open File Manager in cPanel/Plesk
2. Navigate to `public_html/` folder (or `www/` or `htdocs/` - depends on your host)
3. This folder should be EMPTY or have default files
4. Upload ALL files from `frontend-dist/` folder:
   - index.html
   - assets/ folder
   - vite.svg
   - .htaccess file
5. After upload, `public_html/` should contain:
   ```
   public_html/
   ├── index.html
   ├── .htaccess
   ├── assets/
   │   ├── index-*.css
   │   └── index-*.js
   └── vite.svg
   ```

### STEP 2: Upload Backend Files

**Location:** Create `backend/` folder OUTSIDE of `public_html/`

1. In File Manager, go UP one level from `public_html/`
2. You should see your home directory (usually `/home/username/`)
3. Create a new folder called `backend`
4. Upload ALL files from `backend/` folder to this new `backend/` folder
5. Structure should be:
   ```
   /home/username/
   ├── public_html/          (frontend files here)
   └── backend/              (backend files here)
       ├── app/
       ├── public/
       ├── storage/
       ├── vendor/
       └── ... (all other files)
   ```

## Common File Manager Locations

Different hosts use different names for the web root:

- **cPanel:** `public_html/`
- **Plesk:** `httpdocs/` or `public_html/`
- **Some hosts:** `www/` or `htdocs/`
- **Some hosts:** Root domain folder directly

**How to find it:**
- Look for a folder that says "public" or "www" or "httpdocs"
- This is usually the folder your domain points to
- If unsure, check your hosting documentation or contact support

## Making Backend Accessible

After uploading backend, you need to make it accessible via web:

### Option A: Subdomain (Recommended)
1. Create subdomain `api.yourdomain.com` in cPanel
2. Point it to `backend/public/` directory
3. Your API will be at: `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/`

### Option B: Subdirectory
1. Copy contents of `backend/public/` folder
2. Create `api/` folder inside `public_html/`
3. Paste the contents there
4. Your API will be at: `https://yourdomain.com/api/`

## Verification Checklist

After uploading:

- [ ] Frontend files are in `public_html/` (or equivalent)
- [ ] `index.html` is in the root of `public_html/`
- [ ] `.htaccess` file is in `public_html/`
- [ ] Backend files are in `backend/` folder (outside public_html)
- [ ] Backend `public/` folder is accessible via web (subdomain or subdirectory)
- [ ] `.env` file created in `backend/` folder (copy from `.env.example`)

## Troubleshooting

### "Domain shows empty"
- Make sure you uploaded to `public_html/` (not a subfolder)
- Check if your host uses a different name (www, httpdocs, etc.)
- Verify files are actually uploaded (check file count)

### "Files uploaded but website doesn't load"
- Check if `index.html` is in the root
- Verify `.htaccess` file is uploaded
- Check file permissions (should be 644 for files, 755 for folders)

### "Backend not accessible"
- Verify backend `public/` folder is web-accessible
- Check if subdomain is pointing to correct directory
- Verify `.env` file is configured correctly

## Need Help?

1. Check your hosting provider's documentation for:
   - Where website files should be uploaded
   - How to create subdomains
   - File Manager location

2. Contact your hosting support and ask:
   - "Where should I upload my website files?"
   - "How do I create a subdomain for my API?"

3. Common hosting providers:
   - **cPanel:** Usually `public_html/`
   - **Plesk:** Usually `httpdocs/` or `public_html/`
   - **WordPress hosting:** Usually `public_html/` or `www/`
