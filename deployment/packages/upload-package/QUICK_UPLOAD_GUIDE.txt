# QUICK UPLOAD GUIDE - Your Domain File Manager is Empty (This is Normal!)

## ✅ This is Normal!
If your domain's file manager shows an empty folder, that's perfect! You're ready to upload.

## 📁 Where to Upload (Step by Step)

### FRONTEND FILES (Your Website)

**Location:** The EMPTY folder you see (usually called `public_html/` or `www/` or `httpdocs/`)

1. Open the File Manager in your hosting control panel
2. You should see a folder like:
   - `public_html/` (most common)
   - `www/`
   - `httpdocs/`
   - Or just your domain name folder
3. **This folder is currently EMPTY - that's correct!**
4. Upload ALL files from the `frontend-dist/` folder into this empty folder
5. After upload, you should see:
   - index.html
   - .htaccess
   - assets/ (folder)
   - vite.svg

### BACKEND FILES (Your API)

**Location:** Create a NEW folder OUTSIDE the website folder

1. In File Manager, go UP one level from `public_html/`
2. You'll see your home directory (usually `/home/username/` or similar)
3. Create a NEW folder called `backend`
4. Upload ALL files from the `backend/` folder into this new `backend/` folder
5. After upload, you should see inside `backend/`:
   - app/
   - public/
   - storage/
   - vendor/
   - .env.example
   - artisan
   - composer.json
   - ... (many other files)

## 🎯 Visual Structure

After uploading, your file structure should look like this:

```
/home/username/                    (or similar)
│
├── public_html/                  ← Upload frontend-dist/ contents HERE
│   ├── index.html                ← Your website homepage
│   ├── .htaccess                ← Important for routing
│   ├── assets/                  ← CSS and JS files
│   └── vite.svg
│
└── backend/                      ← Create this folder, upload backend/ contents HERE
    ├── app/
    ├── public/                  ← This will be your API endpoint
    ├── storage/
    ├── vendor/
    ├── .env.example
    └── ... (all other backend files)
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Frontend goes in the EMPTY folder** - This is your website root
2. **Backend goes OUTSIDE** - Create a new `backend/` folder at the same level as `public_html/`
3. **Don't put backend inside public_html/** - This is a security risk
4. **Upload ALL files** - Don't skip any files or folders

## 🔍 How to Find Your Website Folder

If you're not sure which folder is your website:

1. **Look for these names:**
   - `public_html/` (most common in cPanel)
   - `www/`
   - `httpdocs/` (Plesk)
   - `htdocs/`
   - Your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com/`)

2. **Check your hosting documentation:**
   - Most hosts have a "File Manager" guide
   - Look for "Where to upload website files"

3. **Contact support:**
   - Ask: "Where should I upload my website files?"
   - They'll tell you the exact folder name

## ✅ After Upload Checklist

- [ ] Frontend files uploaded to `public_html/` (or equivalent)
- [ ] `index.html` is visible in the website folder
- [ ] `.htaccess` file is in the website folder
- [ ] Backend folder created outside `public_html/`
- [ ] All backend files uploaded to `backend/` folder
- [ ] `.env.example` is in `backend/` folder

## 🚀 Next Steps After Upload

1. **Create `.env` file:**
   - In `backend/` folder, copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Edit `.env` with your database credentials

2. **Set up database:**
   - Go to MySQL Databases in cPanel
   - Create database and user
   - Update `.env` with credentials

3. **Make backend accessible:**
   - Option A: Create subdomain `api.yourdomain.com` pointing to `backend/public/`
   - Option B: Copy `backend/public/` contents to `public_html/api/`

4. **Run setup commands** (if terminal/SSH available):
   ```
   cd backend
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan migrate --force
   php artisan storage:link
   php artisan config:cache
   ```

## 🆘 Still Confused?

1. **Take a screenshot** of your File Manager
2. **Check your hosting provider's help docs** for "File Manager" or "Upload files"
3. **Contact your hosting support** - they can guide you to the right folder

Remember: The empty folder you see is PERFECT - that's where your website files go!
