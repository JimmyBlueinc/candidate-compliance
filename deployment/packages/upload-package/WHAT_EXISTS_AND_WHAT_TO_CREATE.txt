# What Exists in Upload Package vs What to Create on VPS

## ✅ What EXISTS in Upload Package

Your upload package already contains:

```
upload-package/
│
├── backend/                    ← EXISTS (all backend files)
│   ├── app/
│   ├── public/                 ← EXISTS (backend API files)
│   │   ├── index.php
│   │   ├── robots.txt
│   │   └── favicon.ico
│   ├── storage/
│   ├── vendor/
│   └── ... (all other backend files)
│
└── frontend-dist/               ← EXISTS (frontend website files)
    ├── index.html
    ├── .htaccess
    ├── assets/
    └── vite.svg
```

## ❌ What You NEED TO CREATE on VPS

On your VPS (in the empty domain folder), you need to CREATE this structure:

```
your-domain-folder/              ← This is EMPTY (you are here)
│
├── index.html                   ← UPLOAD from frontend-dist/
├── .htaccess                    ← UPLOAD from frontend-dist/
├── assets/                      ← UPLOAD from frontend-dist/
│
├── api/                         ← CREATE THIS FOLDER (new)
│   ├── index.php                ← UPLOAD from backend/public/
│   ├── robots.txt               ← UPLOAD from backend/public/
│   └── favicon.ico              ← UPLOAD from backend/public/
│
└── backend/                     ← CREATE THIS FOLDER (new)
    ├── app/                     ← UPLOAD from backend/
    ├── storage/                 ← UPLOAD from backend/
    ├── vendor/                  ← UPLOAD from backend/
    └── ... (all other backend files)
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step: What to Do

### Step 1: Upload Frontend (No folder creation needed)

**Files to upload:** Everything from `frontend-dist/` folder
- Upload directly to your empty domain folder
- No need to create any folder - just upload the files

**Result:** Your domain folder will have:
- index.html
- .htaccess
- assets/ (folder)
- vite.svg

### Step 2: Create `api/` Folder (YOU CREATE THIS)

**Action:** In File Manager, click "New Folder" and name it `api`

**Then upload:** All files from `backend/public/` folder into this new `api/` folder

**Result:** `api/` folder will contain:
- index.php
- robots.txt
- favicon.ico

### Step 3: Create `backend/` Folder (YOU CREATE THIS)

**Action:** In File Manager, click "New Folder" and name it `backend`

**Then upload:** All files from `backend/` folder (EXCEPT the `public/` folder contents)

**Result:** `backend/` folder will contain:
- app/
- storage/
- vendor/
- config/
- routes/
- ... (everything except public/)

## 🎯 Summary

**What exists in package:**
- ✅ `backend/` folder with all files
- ✅ `backend/public/` folder with API files
- ✅ `frontend-dist/` folder with website files

**What you create on VPS:**
- ❌ `api/` folder (you create this)
- ❌ `backend/` folder (you create this, or upload existing one)

**What you upload:**
- ✅ Frontend files from `frontend-dist/` → domain root
- ✅ Backend API files from `backend/public/` → `api/` folder (you create)
- ✅ Backend files from `backend/` → `backend/` folder (you create)

## 🔄 Quick Reference

| Source (in package) | Destination (on VPS) | Action |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| `frontend-dist/` contents | Domain root folder | Upload directly |
| `backend/public/` contents | `api/` folder | Create `api/`, then upload |
| `backend/` (except public/) | `backend/` folder | Create `backend/`, then upload |

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **`api/` folder doesn't exist** - You must create it on the VPS
2. **`backend/` folder exists in package** - But you can either:
   - Upload the entire `backend/` folder as-is, OR
   - Create a new `backend/` folder and upload contents
3. **Frontend files go directly** - No folder creation needed, just upload to domain root

The package has everything you need, but you need to arrange it properly on your VPS!
