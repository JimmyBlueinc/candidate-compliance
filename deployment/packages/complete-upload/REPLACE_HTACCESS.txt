# URGENT: Replace .htaccess Files

## The Problem
Your server is showing: "Invalid command '﻿RewriteEngine'"
This is caused by a BOM (Byte Order Mark) character in the .htaccess file.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Delete and Re-upload (Easiest)
1. Go to your file manager on the server
2. DELETE the existing `.htaccess` file in the root
3. DELETE the existing `api/.htaccess` file
4. Upload the NEW `.htaccess` files from this package
5. Make sure they're uploaded as plain text (not with BOM)

### Option 2: Edit Directly on Server
1. Open `.htaccess` in your file manager's editor
2. Replace ALL content with this (root .htaccess):

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

3. Open `api/.htaccess` and replace with:

```
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,R=301]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```

### Option 3: Minimal Version (If still not working)

**Root .htaccess:**
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

**api/.htaccess:**
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```

## Important Notes
- Make sure there are NO invisible characters at the start
- Save as plain text (UTF-8 without BOM)
- No spaces before "RewriteEngine"
- First line should start immediately with "RewriteEngine"

## After Fixing
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try accessing the site again
3. Check if the error is gone
