# Fixed .htaccess Files - BOM Removed

## Problem
The error "Invalid command '﻿RewriteEngine'" was caused by a BOM (Byte Order Mark) character at the start of the .htaccess file.

## Solution
I've recreated both .htaccess files without BOM encoding:

1. **Root .htaccess** - For frontend routing
2. **api/.htaccess** - For Laravel API routing

## What Changed
- Removed all BOM characters
- Simplified structure (removed IfModule tags that might cause issues)
- Ensured clean UTF-8 encoding without BOM

## Next Steps
1. Delete the old .htaccess files from your server
2. Upload the new ones from this package
3. Test the site again

## If Still Not Working

If you still get errors, try this minimal version:

### Root .htaccess (minimal):
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

### api/.htaccess (minimal):
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```
