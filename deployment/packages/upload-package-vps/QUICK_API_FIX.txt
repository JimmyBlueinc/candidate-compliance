# Quick Fix for Network Error

## The Problem
Frontend shows but login gives "Network Error" = API not accessible

## Quick Test
Open in browser: https://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api/health

**If you see `{"status":"ok"}`** → API works, problem is frontend API URL
**If you see 404/500** → API not configured correctly

## Most Likely Fix: Rebuild Frontend

The frontend was built with wrong API URL. You need to rebuild it:

### On Your Local Machine:

1. Open terminal in your project
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api" > .env.production
   npm run build
   ```

3. Upload ALL files from `frontend/dist/` to your domain root (replace existing files)

4. Test login again

## Alternative: Check These

1. **API folder exists?** Check if `api/` folder has `index.php`
2. **Backend .env exists?** Check if `backend/.env` file exists
3. **Database configured?** Check `backend/.env` has correct database credentials
4. **Test API:** Try `https://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api/health` in browser

## If API Health Doesn't Work

1. Check `api/index.php` - paths should be:
   ```php
   require __DIR__.'/../backend/vendor/autoload.php';
   $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../backend/bootstrap/app.php';
   ```

2. Check `backend/.env` exists and has:
   ```env
   APP_URL=https://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api
   FRONTEND_URL=https://cpdemo.blueinctech.com
   ```

3. Set permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 775 backend/storage backend/bootstrap/cache
   ```

## Still Not Working?

Check browser console (F12) → Network tab → See what URL it's trying to connect to
