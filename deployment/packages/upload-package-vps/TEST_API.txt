# Test Your API - Step by Step

## Step 1: Test API Health Endpoint

Open this URL in your browser:
```
http://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api/health
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

**If you see this:** ✅ API is working! Problem is frontend API URL.

**If you see 404:** ❌ API path wrong or `api/` folder missing
**If you see 500:** ❌ Backend configuration issue

## Step 2: Check What Frontend is Trying to Connect To

1. **Open your website:** http://cpdemo.blueinctech.com
2. **Press F12** to open browser DevTools
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Try to login**
5. **Look at the error message** - it will show what URL it's trying

**Common issues:**
- Trying to connect to `http://localhost:8000/api` (wrong!)
- Trying to connect to wrong domain
- CORS error

## Step 3: Most Likely Solution

The frontend was built with the wrong API URL. You need to rebuild it:

### On Your Local Machine:

```bash
cd frontend
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api" > .env.production
npm run build
```

Then upload ALL files from `frontend/dist/` to replace files in your domain root.

## Step 4: Verify Backend Configuration

1. **Check `backend/.env` exists:**
   - Should have `APP_URL=http://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api`
   - Should have `FRONTEND_URL=http://cpdemo.blueinctech.com`
   - Should have database credentials

2. **Check `api/index.php` exists:**
   - Should be in `api/` folder
   - Should have correct paths to backend

3. **Check file permissions:**
   - `backend/storage/` should be 775
   - `backend/bootstrap/cache/` should be 775

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Test: http://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api/health returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] `backend/.env` file exists and configured
- [ ] `api/index.php` file exists
- [ ] Frontend rebuilt with correct API URL: `http://cpdemo.blueinctech.com/api`
- [ ] File permissions set correctly
